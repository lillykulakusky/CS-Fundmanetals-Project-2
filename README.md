This project implements a simple Minecraft-style hostile mob battle simulator in Java.
The core of the program is the Mob class, which models a hostile mob with health, strength, 
and the ability to attack other mobs. The simulator demonstrates object-oriented programming 
concepts such as encapsulation, immutability, method overriding, and static methods.
